        Jeff serves as the ownerâ€™s representative, and thus is committed to
        representing the best interests of his clients. He serves as a member of
        the project team (owner, architect, construction manager) and, with the
        design team, provides services from pre-design through construction,
        including contracts, overall budgeting and scheduling. In this capacity,
