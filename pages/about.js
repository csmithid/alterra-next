        Jeff serves as the ownerâ€™s representative, and thus is committed to
        representing the best interests of his clients. He serves as a member of
        the project team (owner, architect, construction manager) and, with the
        design team, leads the process from pre-design through construction,
        including contracts, overall budgeting and scheduling. In this capacity,
        Jeff has earned a reputation for being a collaborative, creative
        problem-solver, who routinely completes projects on time and on budget.

        Recent Alterra projects include a $12 million, 16,000-square-foot
        European country manor home in Cismont, Virginia, as well as the
        development of RiverBluff, a conservation community of 22 homes in the
        Woolen Mills neighborhood of Charlottesville. Jeff was also a team
        member in the development of a $33 million resort complex for Ashley
        House in Keswick, Virginia, which included a 48-room luxury inn and a
        golf course designed by Arnold Palmer. Jeff graduated with a B.S. in
        Architecture from the University of Virginia in 1980.
