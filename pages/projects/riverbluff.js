        History isn't like that. History unravels gently, like an old sweater.
        It has been patched and darned many times, reknitted to suit different
        people, shoved in a box under the sink of censorship to be cut up for
        the dusters of propaganda, yet it always - eventually - manages to
        spring back into its old familar shape. History has a habit of changing
        the people who think they are changing it. History always has a few
        tricks up its frayed sleeve. It's been around a long time.
